Nano BCL
========

This is experiment to create NanoBCL with limited subset of types. This allow create completely separate ecosystem of libraries which has different constraints
- Smart Contracts
- Embedded devices (admittedly NanoFramework already exists for this)
- UEFI environment (if continue what Michal Strechovsky did in this space)
- Your own Unity :) again, if you are brave enough.
